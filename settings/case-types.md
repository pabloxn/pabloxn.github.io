# Case Types

## What are task templates?

Case Types are a definition of cases, which is fundamentally a collection of appointments. You can define a name, description and the number of associated appointments and their types. This does stop you adding more or reducing the number of appointments for a case, but give the defaults.

## How do I create an appointment type?

1. Under settings choose 'Case Types'.
2. Click the ![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2019-01-23-at-13.22.51.png)Add button and you will the Case Type Template Form.
3. You will need to give the template a name, preferably something that is meaningful to its purpose.
4. \[Optional\] You can add a description. This is optional and is there as an aide memoire.
5. You then need to define the number of sessions. It defaults to 1.
6. Then you will need to set the default appointment type. When you create an appointment this is the appointment type used.
7. If you have more than 1 session set then you will have access to a initial default appointment type and more than 2 then a final appointment type.
8. Once you have done that you can click the ![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2019-03-21-at-12.58.35.png) Save button and you will be taken back to the list view.
