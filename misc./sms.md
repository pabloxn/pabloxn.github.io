# SMS

## Overview 

inClinic has a built in SMS system for the sending of text messages to clients. It is quite simple to use.

It is also integrated into the workflow system so automated text messages can be sent out at various trigger events \(e.g. the creation of a client in inClinic\)

### Sending a Message

The messaging system is always available regardless of where in inClinic you are.

1. Click on the ![](../.gitbook/assets/comments-alt%20%281%29.svg) icon at the top right of the toolbar and a sidebar on the right hand side will appear.
2. The first field of the sidebar is  'Send To'. Enter or select a number. When you do this if there any messages already sent to this number they will display.

   _You can manually add a number or you can select the number from the drop down icon at the side. This field is context sensitive. If you are in a particular client then the drop down list will contain the directory mobile entries for that client._ 

3. At the bottom of the sidebar is the text area for writing your message. Type your message here.
4. Click the paper plane to send.

At the very bottom of the side bar is a label that says SMS Credits. This shows how many credits are left to use, before you need to buy more.
