#### Activating the task templates

When the clinician sets appointment status to 'Attended' then the user will be asked if they want to activate the associated task template. If the user responds in the affirmative  then they will be activated.

If the clinician then changes their mind and changes the status back then the created tasks will be removed.

If the clinician set the attendance status to 'Did not Attend' \(DNA\) then then DNA task template will initiated. The default template for the [DNA task template]() is set in general settings.
