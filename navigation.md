At the top right of the main menu you will see an arrow icon. Click on this icon to collapse the menu, showing icons only. The menu will change to pointing to the right. If you click this icon it will expand to the full menu \(with icons and text\). The menu will collapse automatically when you select a page.

At the bottom of the left hand side is your user icon where you can sign-out of InClinic.

## Title Bar

Across the top of the remainder of the screen is the title bar which shows you what area you are looking at.

At the far side is the current time and a "?" button that will bring you here to the user-guidance.
