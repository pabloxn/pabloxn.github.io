# Clinic

The clinic Worksheet controls the clinic. Each appointment for a particular clinic is here and when clicked upon opens up the details and actions for the clinic. It is split into two sections:

| Section | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [The Clinic List](list.md) | Displays the list of appointments |
| [The Appointment Details](details.md) | Displays the details of the appointment and enables several actions to be taken related to the appointment. |

{% hint style="info" %}
Read the clinic list and appointment details before using the walkthroughs.
