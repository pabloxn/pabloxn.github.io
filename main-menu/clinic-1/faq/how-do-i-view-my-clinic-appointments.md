# How do I view my clinic appointments?

The date is set to today by default and the relevant clinic for today is preselected. So you should see a list clients below the date selector and the venue selector. 

If however you want to look at a clinic in the future then:

1. Either type in the date or click the date icon to show a calendar to select a date.
2. \[optional\] If there is a clinic on that day it should automatically set the venue however you select a venue by clicking on the venue and selecting from the list.
