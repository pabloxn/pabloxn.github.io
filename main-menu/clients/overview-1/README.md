### Filter Bar

This has one field to enter a text filter indicated by a ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/search.svg) icon. This will filter the clients list by any text entered into this field.

### Table Header

This contains the header information for the table. It has two features:

1. Sort: If you click on any of the headers it will sort to that field. If you click it again it will reverse the sort and clicking it again will remove the sort.
2. Filter: Each field is filterable by clicking on the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/filter.svg) icon and a small pop-up will open giving you options to consider.
