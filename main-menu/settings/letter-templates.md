# Letter Templates

## What are letter templates?

Letter templates are here to create automated correspondence, which can be sent as emails or exported as a document \(Word or PDF\). These are used in the create correspondence action in a client or via the [workflow templates](workflow-templates/).

{% hint style="info" %}
 Letter templates can create useful reminders and confirmations to your clients without the user having to type them.
{% endhint %}

## How do I create an letter template?

1. Under settings choose 'Letter Templates'
2. Click the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2019-01-23-at-13.22.51.png)Add button and you will the Letter Template Form.
3. You will need to give the template a name, preferably something that is meaningful to its purpose.
4. Write a suitable entry for subject. The subject field is required for emails and is the equivalent field in an email form.
5. Select whether this template is designed for letters/emails destined for clients or contacts in the The For Whom field.
6. Then you can create the message. There are two tabs. The first is for the text body and contains a full Rich Text editor with the addition of being able to add place holders for record details. To do this click  'Add Field' and then select the field you want. The fields menu will insert field holders at the cursor. These fields will be filled in when the message is created from the template. See [Data Dictionary](../../technical-user-guides/data-dictionary.md) for further guidance. If you are familiar with 'Mail Merge' in Microsoft Office Word then it preforms a similar task.
7. \[Optional\] If you require default attachments, then you can add them under the second tab. The first field is the default attachments for the email. The documents available here are located in the [company](general/) settings and in the venue settings. Venue documents are selected by choosing Venue docs. See venue documents for further explanation.
8. \[Optional\] If you require different default documents per clinician then you can use the next table. This will override the previous field for clinician. Click the insert button to add new attachments. In the first field select the clinician and in the second field choose the relevant documents. The documents available here are located in the [user](users.md) settings and in the venue settings. Venue documents are selected by choosing Venue docs. See venue documents for further explanation. To finish click the tick.
