The page is split into five areas:

1. Toolbar
2. Filter Bar
3. Contact List Header
4. Contact List
5. Contact List Footer

### Toolbar

The right hand side has three buttons:

| Button | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-06-08-at-12.55.54.png)  | This exports the contact list to a pdf |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-02-01-at-15.28.40.png)  | This opens the contacts stats page |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/docs_add01.png)  | This open the Add contact page |

### Filter Bar

This has one field to enter a text filter indicated by a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/search.svg) icon. This will filter the contact list by any text entered into this field.

### Contact List Header

This contains the header information for the table. It has two features:

1. Sort: If you click on any of the headers it will sort to that field. If you click it again it will reverse the sort and clicking it again will remove the sort. The direction is indicated by an arrow, next to the column title.
2. Filter: Each field is filterable by clicking on the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/filter.svg) icon and a small pop-up will open giving you options to consider.

### Contact List

This is the list of available contacts. If you wish to open one click the line.

### Contact List Footer

Shows a navigator for working through the records and a number showing where you are and how many records there are.
