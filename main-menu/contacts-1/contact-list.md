The page is split into three areas:

1. ToolBar
2. Filter Bar
3. Contact List

### Toolbar

The toolbar has on the left shows the number of contacts. It is split into the number on contacts showing versus what is available.

The right hand side has three buttons:

| Button | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-06-08-at-12.55.54.png)  | This exports the contact list to a pdf |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-02-01-at-15.28.40.png)  | This opens the contacts stats page |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/docs_add01.png)  | This open the Add contact page |

### Filter Bar

This has one field to enter a text filter indicated by a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/search.svg) icon. This will filter the contact list by any text entered into this field.

### Table Header

This contains the header information for the table. It has two features:

1. Sort: If you click on any of the headers it will sort to that field. If you click it again it will reverse the sort and clicking it again will remove the sort.
2. Filter: Each field is filterable by clicking on the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/filter.svg) icon and a small pop-up will open giving you options to consider.

### Contact List

This is the list of available contacts. If you wish to open one click the line.
