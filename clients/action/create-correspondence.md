# Create Correspondence

## Getting Started

You need to make sure that you have created  at least one [letter template](../../settings/letter-templates.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
 Letter templates enable you create a letter that has fields that will automatically fill in when used in this page.
{% endhint %}

### Creating a letter

It is very simple to create a letter from the template. You just need to select the template from the dropdown field. When you have done that the system will take the template and fill the current clients details. 

Once that has been done you can edit the letter as you like.

Finally you have three choices:

* PDF
* Word
* Email

The first two create a file that will be saved to your computer. The final will open a dialog for you to enter the email addresses. If an email address exists in the clients details then it will automatically fill that in for you.
