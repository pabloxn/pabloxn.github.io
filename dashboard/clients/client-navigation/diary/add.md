# Add

Clicking on the add button will open a pop-up window.

This will pre-populate the Client, Clinic and Clinician \(based on the client information\), therefore you should check that the clinician is the one requested in the LOI and the clinic is still the closest to the client’s current address.

· Select **Case** from the drop-down list that shows all cases for that client

· Select the **Appointment Type** from the drop-down list – the appointment type selected may affect the duration of the appointment

· Select date

This has a toggle switch to change the view between the appointment date list \(this shows dates of free slots for the selected clinician and the selected location\) or calendar view.

· Click on the required **date** to see a list of the available appointment times

· Click on the required **time**

· If the client has confirmed their attendance tick the **Confirmed** tick box otherwise leave this empty to ensure this is followed up at a later date

· If you have charges to add you can add them here otherwise

· Click on **Save**
