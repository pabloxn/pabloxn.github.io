# Appointments

### How to add an appointment

Appointments can be entered in a few places. These include the diary and the clients diary. 

### Appointment Triggers

The appointment has two triggers \(Triggers are activities that activate other events\).

#### Creation

The first trigger is the creation of the appointment. When this occurs:

* It creates scheduled SMS Messages from the [SMS Templates](../../overview/sms-templates.md) if the SMS systems has been set up.

#### Attendance 

The second trigger is when the clinician records the attendence of the client.

* It creates the tasks from the Task Templates that were assigned to the [Appointment Types](../../overview/appointment-types.md) in the appointment.
