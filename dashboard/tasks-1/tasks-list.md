### Filtering

There are several ways to filter your tasks to enable you to work better:

* The text field next to the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/search.svg) icon enable you filter using the task description. Just type into this field and the list will only show tasks with a description that matches.
* The drop down with the text 'FILTER:'. The text next to filter shows with filter is active. If you choose from the drop down that filter will be applied.
* The drop down with the text 'PERIOD:'. The text next to filter shows with filter is active. If you choose from the drop down that filter will be applied. This filters by date range.

## Actions

### Bulk Actions

It is possible to manipulate more than one task at a time use bulk actions.

How to do this:

1. Click the checkbox on each line that you want to change.
2. Once more than one checkbox is checked, the 'BULK ACTIONS' drop down will become active.
3. Select the relevant action you want to apply to the selected tasks.
4. A dialog box will appear to make sure that you want to go ahead. You can say 'YES' if it you want to or 'NO' if you don't. The 'assign to...' option is different because it will ask who you want to assign to the task.

### Add a task
