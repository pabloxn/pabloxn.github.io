2. In the tasks page click the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/docs_tasks02%20%281%29.png) button.
3. The display then shows columns with labels above them.Each column contains the tasks assigned to that label. The first column is your tasks labeled \(My Tasks\) and is static. The other columns are the other users and scrolls horizontally. 
4. To reassign tasks to a different user drag a task from one column to another. This is done by clicking and holding the mouse button then moving \(dragging\) the selected task to another column and then releasing the mouse button which drops the task into the other column which assigns it that user.
